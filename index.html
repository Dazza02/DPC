		<h1>Best Seller | Young & Old Photos</h1>
		<p>Young & Old Photos are photos combining the past and present versions of a person into one photo. They are
			great gift ideas for birthdays and other significant milestones!</p>

		<p>To make a young and old photo, you will need:</p>
		<p>- A photo of the person from their past</p>
		<p>- A photo of the person from the present day</p>

		<p>NOTE</p>
		<p>It is prefered that both photos are of the best possible quality to produce the best final product</p>
