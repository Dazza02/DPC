			  <h2>About Me!</h2>
			  <p>Hi, I’m Dale and I love using photoshop. Using your creative ideas and photos, combined with my knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, I can help you to make those ideas a reality.<p>
	
				I’ve always had a creative side but I didn’t always have something that allowed me to express my creativity. That is until I learned of Adobe Photoshop. The only problem was, that my family and friends, considered it too 	difficult and time-consuming to learn. However, I stuck with it and learnt all I could.</p>
			
				<p>Now I want to use my years of learning and experience inside Adobe Photoshop to help you create memories and photos that you may have never thought possible.</p>
			
				<h2>My Why!</h2>
			
				<p>From the moment I started learning Photoshop in 2016, I fell in love with it. It became my passion. I began learning it with passion. Soon after, my family caught on. They started asking me to touch up family photos and make 	unique birthday photo presents.</p>
			
				<p>It was then that I understood that I had a passion for Photoshop. I wanted to share what I learnt with the world.
			
			​	Once I knew that, I started Dales Photo Creations in 2020 to share my skills with the community to help them create photos that they never knew existed before.</p>
