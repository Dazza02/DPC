<h2>About Me!</h2>
	<p>Hi, I’m Dale and I love using photoshop. Using your creative ideas and photos, combined with my
		knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, I can help you to make those ideas a reality.
	<p>
		I’ve always had a creative side but I didn’t always have something that allowed me to express my
		creativity. That is until I learned of Adobe Photoshop. The only problem was, that my family and
		friends, considered it too difficult and time-consuming to learn. However, I stuck with it and
		learnt all I could.</p>

	<p>Now I want to use my years of learning and experience inside Adobe Photoshop to help you create
		memories and photos that you may have never thought possible.</p>

	<h2>My Why!</h2>

	<p>From the moment I started learning Photoshop in 2016, I fell in love with it. It became my passion. I
		began learning it with passion. Soon after, my family caught on. They started asking me to touch up
		family photos and make unique birthday photo presents.</p>

	<p>It was then that I understood that I had a passion for Photoshop. I wanted to share what I learnt
		with the world.

		​ Once I knew that, I started Dales Photo Creations in 2020 to share my skills with the community to
		help them create photos that they never knew existed before.</p>
